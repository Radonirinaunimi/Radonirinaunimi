#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tanjona Rabemananjara but you can just call me Tanjona. I am currently a PhD candidate in Theoretical Physics at the [UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Milano](https://www.unimi.it/en) working as a part of the [N3PDF](n3pdf.mi.infn.it/). My main research interests lie in the area of the theory of strong interactions and Machine Learning.

If I am not doing physics or coding, I a bookworm (I like very much reading). I am also passionate about linux in gerenal, you can check my [RICE](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=bookworm) [here](https://github.com/Radonirinaunimi/dotfiles) where I include all my dotfiles.
